I wanted to track progress of COVID-19 in my home country - Czechia and 
compare it with the worst hit country in Europe - Italy. 
Time series start at day 0: 
- First day in given country when first case was confirmed 
- First day in given country when first death was confirmed
Thanks to this time alternation, we can see progress from first death
and confirmed case as the outbreak would started in both countries in the
same day.

Data for Czechia are multiplied to represent the fact that 
Italy has almost 6 times bigger population than Czechia.

This simple statistic show progression of:
- number of deaths 
- number of confirmed cases
during COVID-19 outbreak. 

Graphs are comparing time line in:
- Czechia
- Italy 

Data are used from:

Big thanks to them!
