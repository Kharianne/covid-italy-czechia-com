I wanted to track progress of COVID-19 in my home country - Czechia and
compare it with the worst hit country in Europe - Italy.
Time series start at day 0:

- First day in given country when first case was confirmed
- First day in given country when first death was confirmed

Thanks to this time alternation, we can see progress from first death
and confirmed case as the outbreak would be started in both countries in the
same day.

Data for Czechia are multiplied to represent the fact that
Italy has almost 6 times bigger population than Czechia.

This simple statistic show progression of:

- number of deaths
- number of confirmed cases
  during COVID-19 outbreak.

Graphs are comparing timeline in:

- Czechia
- Italy

Data are used from:

Big thanks to them!
